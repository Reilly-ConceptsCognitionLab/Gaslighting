Description: This R package produces likelihood estimates and visualizations for whether a text sample of interest reflects 'gaslighting'. These estimates are derived from yoking affective norms for 22 distinct dimensions to every content word in the text sample of interest. The package then computes the cosine angle of this vector to the base vector derived from analyzing hundreds of explicit definitions of gaslighting produced by undergraduate psychology students.
